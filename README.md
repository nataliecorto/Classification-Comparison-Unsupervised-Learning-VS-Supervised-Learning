# Classification-Comparison-Unsupervised-Learning-VS-Supervised-Learning
Unsupervised classification of Heart Disease using K-Means Clustering / Supervised classification of Heart Disease using Tree Based Classification

# Dataset Information 
The Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used for this project.

Specifically, we will be using one of the processed datasets from Cleveland, which has 14 attributes (most important ones used in other scientific works) from the total 76 features.

The dataset comprises 303 observations, 13 features, and 1 target attribute. The 13 features include the results of non-invasive diagnostic tests along with other relevant patient information. The target variable includes the result of the invasive coronary angiogram which represents the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in the patient with 0 representing the absence of CHD and labels 1-4 representing the presence of CHD.
